## Foiltrans

This is the original version created by Bjornar Svingen (bjornar.svingen@ktv.no)  according to internet lore.  This is posted here for posterity since the original dissapeared from the internet circa 2018.

Download the contents of the **FoilTrans** folder onto your Windows PC and follow the original instructions to download.  

Here is how Richard Burd used to use XFLR5 and FoilTrans to import airfoils into X-Plane.  This workflow was tested in November of 2025 with Windows11, [XFLR5](https://www.xflr5.tech/xflr5.htm) v.6.61, and X-Plane12/Airfoilmaker-12.  NOTE: In XFLR5, you can import or create your own original airfoil geometry.
